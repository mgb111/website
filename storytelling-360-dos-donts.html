      360° storytelling offers unmatched immersion—but only if done right. Unlike traditional video, your viewer isn’t looking through a fixed frame—they're *inside* the scene. That changes how you write, shoot, and direct. Below are key dos and don’ts based on what works (and what doesn’t) in real-world immersive storytelling.
    </p>

    <div>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-blue-800">✅ DO: Let viewers explore</h2>
      <p>Use the entire 360° space intentionally. Place meaningful action, characters, or sound cues in different areas of the sphere so viewers can discover the story through interaction—not just passive watching.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-blue-800">🚫 DON'T: Overload every direction</h2>
      <p>Yes, it’s 360—but not everything has to happen all at once. Overwhelming the viewer with simultaneous actions in all directions can break focus and cause decision fatigue. Think “guided freedom.”</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-blue-800">✅ DO: Use spatial audio</h2>
      <p>Sound is your secret weapon. Use directional audio cues to draw attention to where something is about to happen. A whisper behind the viewer or a loud crash to the left makes the experience instinctive and engaging.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-blue-800">🚫 DON'T: Treat it like flat video</h2>
      <p>Placing your main actor front and center like a traditional frame defeats the purpose. Instead, think in scenes and setups. Let your viewer feel like they’re standing *inside* the room—not just watching it.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-blue-800">✅ DO: Slow down the pacing</h2>
      <p>Give viewers time to look around. Fast cuts or rapid-fire edits feel jarring and disorienting in 360°. A slower pace allows the audience to absorb the environment, creating a sense of place and presence.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-blue-800">🚫 DON'T: Move the camera too much</h2>
      <p>360 cameras don’t like shaky movements. Unless you're working with a stabilization rig, keep your shots grounded. Otherwise, you risk making your viewers dizzy or even nauseous.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="bg-blue-100 p-6 rounded-lg mt-12">
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Takeaway</h3>
      <p>In 360 storytelling, you're not just directing a scene—you're directing attention. Respect the viewer’s agency, use space and sound wisely, and focus on experiences that feel natural within the sphere. Get it right, and your story will stay with them long after the headset—or phone—is off.</p>
